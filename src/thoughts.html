    <h3>
     grief
    </h3>
    <p>
     May 3rd, 2020
    </p>
    <p>
     Recently, I was listening to a talk by Professor Scott Galloway to UC Berkeley students. In it, he discussed much of his philosophy around work and life. I'm a very inquisitive individual and I appreciate looking for the meta reasons that we feel and act the way that we do, so I enjoyed his thoughts. One line that deeply resonated with me was how Galloway described success. He said, "Success is when bad things happen to you, you take your time to mourn, then move on." Unfortunately, due to events in my personal life, I've mulled over this thought much more intimately than I expected. I won't go into the specifics of my grief but rather my feelings about grief as an energy for introspection and outward empathy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grief is usually an emotion tied to negative events in our lives that break our hopes or expectations of an experience. Grief can stem from not making the grades one hopes for, not being able to maintain a relationship one cares for, or losing a loved one. Though the intensity and cause can all be vastly different, there is one continuity: your grief is trying to tell you something about yourself &amp; how you see the world. For me, my personal grief usually tells me what I appreciate in those around me and how I wish to improve myself. It's important to look at your grief closely to find these elements because it's essential to not losing yourself in thoughts of hopelessness.

    <p>
     Though I know I haven't yet moved on from my current grief, I'm appreciative of Galloway's sage words and I hope they can guide me to introspect in these difficult times. I hope you'll take a moment to look at what your grief means to you as well.

     inspiration
    </h3>
    <p>
     There's nothing more inspiring than making choices that place you around people that you care about. It's dually powerful when you find these wonderful folks that are doing extraordinary, impressive things. The exercise possibilities you never imagined and you want to inspire them too! I would say that all that I have achieved in my life rests squarely on the shoulders of those who I've had the absolute fortune of observing throughout my life, be it friends, family, classmates, and random passersby.

    <h3>
     motivation
    </h3>
    <p>
     Motivation is quite the fickle beast. I find that the best time to really ponder motivation is when you're up far too late doing something you should've done much sooner. As Douglas Adams said: "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by." In precisely the opposite way, I do not like that wooshing sound of deadlines flying by and if nothing else, I continually hope to improve on my base of motivations and pursuits so I can find those deadlines I'd never want to miss.
