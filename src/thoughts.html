			<h3>motivation</h3>
			<p>Motivation is quite the fickle beast. I find that the best time to really ponder motivation is when you're up far too late doing something you should've done much sooner. As Douglas Adams said: "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by." In precisely the opposite way, I do not like that wooshing sound of deadlines flying by and if nothing else, I continually hope to improve on my base of motivations and pursuits so I can find those deadlines I'd never want to miss.</p>

			<h3>inspiration</h3>
			<p>There's nothing more inspiring than making choices that place you around people that you care about. It's dually powerful when you find these wonderful folks that are doing extraordinary, impressive things. The exercise possibilities you never imagined and you want to inspire them too! I would say that all that I have achieved in my life rests squarely on the shoulders of those who I've had the absolute fortune of observing throughout my life, be it friends, family, classmates, and random passersby.</p>
