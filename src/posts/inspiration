inspiration
There's nothing more inspiring than making choices that place you around people that you care about. It's dually powerful when you find these wonderful folks that are doing extraordinary, impressive things. The exercise possibilities you never imagined and you want to inspire them too! I would say that all that I have achieved in my life rests squarely on the shoulders of those who I've had the absolute fortune of observing throughout my life, be it friends, family, classmates, and random passersby.
