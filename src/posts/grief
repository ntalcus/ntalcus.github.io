grief 
May 3rd, 2020
Recently, I was listening to a talk by Professor Scott Galloway to UC Berkeley students. In it, he discussed much of his philosophy around work and life. I'm a very inquisitive individual and I appreciate looking for the meta reasons that we feel and act the way that we do, so I enjoyed his thoughts. One line that deeply resonated with me was how Galloway described success. He said, "Success is when bad things happen to you, you take your time to mourn, then move on." Unfortunately, due to events in my personal life, I've mulled over this thought much more intimately than I expected. I won't go into the specifics of my grief but rather my feelings about grief as an energy for introspection and outward empathy.
Grief is usually an emotion tied to negative events in our lives that break our hopes or expectations of an experience. Grief can stem from not making the grades one hopes for, not being able to maintain a relationship one cares for, or losing a loved one. Though the intensity and cause can all be vastly different, there is one continuity: your grief is trying to tell you something about yourself & how you see the world. For me, my personal grief usually tells me what I appreciate in those around me and how I wish to improve myself. It's important to look at your grief closely to find these elements because it's essential to not losing yourself in thoughts of hopelessness.
Though I know I haven't yet moved on from my current grief, I'm appreciative of Galloway's sage words and I hope they can guide me to introspect in these difficult times. I hope you'll take a moment to look at what your grief means to you as well.
