motivation
Motivation is quite the fickle beast. I find that the best time to really ponder motivation is when you're up far too late doing something you should've done much sooner. As Douglas Adams said: "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by." In precisely the opposite way, I do not like that wooshing sound of deadlines flying by and if nothing else, I continually hope to improve on my base of motivations and pursuits so I can find those deadlines I'd never want to miss.
