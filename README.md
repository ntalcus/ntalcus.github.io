# Noah Alcus' github.io Page

Hi! My name is Noah and I'm a senior studying CS at Berkeley. This is my first ever stab at a website and I wanted to get it up for the sake of iterating on it with the feedback of friends/family/peers/strangers in coffee shops. 

Thanks for checking it out! :)

Curently, this site is built using just HTML/CSS. I'm working on integrating some JS soon.
